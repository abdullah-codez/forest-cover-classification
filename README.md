## **🚀 Project Workflow**

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Imported dataset and added column names.

   * Explored data and checked for missing values.

2. **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**

   * Distribution analysis and histogram plotting.

   * Checked for skew and capped extreme outliers.

3. **Modeling & Evaluation**

   * Split dataset into train and test sets.

   * Trained **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers.

   * Evaluated using **classification reports** and **confusion matrices**.

## **📈 Results**

* Both models performed well on multi-class classification.

* Metrics included **precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy**.

* Confusion matrices highlighted class-wise prediction performance.
